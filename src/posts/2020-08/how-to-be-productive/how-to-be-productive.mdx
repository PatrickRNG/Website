Often I find myself planning my days, but shortly after forgetting about it or doing something else. This happens because after doing something that makes me happy, like play videogames or watch youtube all-day, our brain likes it, and doesn't want to do other things. It's great to do what makes us happy, and that's necessary also, but what about our other needs? Like growing ourselves in other ways such as studying, reading, even our daily tasks, everything is important and we need to do it, to continue growing.

But first, before going on more details on how you can be more productive, I need to make something more clear, no one (or almost no one), can add healthy habits to their days easily, especially if you have unhealthy habits, you need to improve yourself first. If you procrastinate all day, you probably will not be able to be fully disciplined on your daily schedule right away, that's a goal for a different version of yourself, a better version, where you have fixed some unhealthy habits first, or got better at it, then it will be much easier and natural. I don't know if you noticed, but healthy people usually have a healthier life, you can't be fit and also eat bad food, but if you change your diet gradually, you can start being fit. It's like a chain of healthy habits, start one, get better at it, and you will almost automatically want to start another.

**It's easier to fix bad habits first than adding new ones.**

Set small goals first, start to get used to it.
For example, regardless of the day, I try to study at least 2 hours, and always go to sleep before 12 am. After some time it was natural for me, and it will be natural for you.

Some other daily goals that I accomplish:

- Wake up early in weekdays
- Leave work early
- Workout every weekday
- Have at least one "free" hour every day (usually 1 hour before I go to sleep)

I value time a lot, it's honestly the most valuable aspect of my life for me, so most of my goals have time involved into it, to use the most of my day and life.

## Having goals and making a to-be list

Now let's get more practical, if you do some quick research, it's easy to say that a lot of people have trouble to accomplish their daily tasks, and most of the time it is because they are just creating a to-do list and trying every day to remember to do the tasks on it. But doing just a to-do list usually doesn't work for the majority of people, so **try making a to-be list**, where you note who you want to become, in every item in this list create a to-do list with things that you can do to achieve it.

I know it sounds weird, but there is more than one way of doing it, some people like to note who they want to be that day (confident, healthier, etc), I personally prefer to note who I want to be in general, but that is better for more long-term tasks and goals I guess, the main point is to try it, write it down what's on your mind for who you want to be, doesn't matter if it is for that day or forever.

For example, if one item in your to-be list is to be healthier, you can have a set of tasks for it, like eat less carbs at breakfast. Or if another item is to be a better developer in a short period, maybe you could add a task to study 4 hours a day, if it is too hard, start with 1 or 2, or to work on your side-project, that's on you, and I encourage you to stop for some minutes to think about it and fill your tasks and goals.

Another very important point, don't just think about it, write it down, make a list of what you want to accomplish each day, your to-be and to-do list, and have reminders, what works for me is setting an alarm clock for an hour that I need to do something like wake up, stop working, go to sleep, study, eat, but do what matches with your desired lifestyle.

If you are having a hard time, try to force yourself more in the beginning to start the tasks, even if your brain is screaming at you to continue awake, just stop, think for a second, and force yourself to go to sleep. But remember, don't be too harsh on yourself, it takes time and effort, consistency is key for creating habits.
A very very good trick that works for me, is to always start with the productive tasks first, so start with what you need to do, then what you want to do. That way you will naturally do it, and maybe you'll enjoy it and work for a little more, which is great. If you are having motivation issues to do anything, you could do first the tasks that are not really important, and are relatively easier, but needs to be done, because since you're already without any motivation, just try to do it already and get rid of it, sometimes doing it will at least make you start something and take action, kinda like an initial push.

Don't try to change everything at once, you'll get easily overwhelmed, do one thing at a time and eventually, you will become more disciplined and focused.

Another great thing to do is to clean your workspace, have your desk organized. If you can (you should), clean your place too, it will make a lot of difference in your concentration skills.

I hope it helped someone! it's not something set in stone, everyone has a different way to do something, it could or 
not work for you, try different things.
Remember, always have a set of goals, that way, every action on your life will be towards that goal.
