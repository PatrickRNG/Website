I've had a hard time trying to have the tray window appear in the correct spot for all platforms since in Linux the `tray.getBounds()` doesn't work.
To solve that, we can use the mouse position for Linux, and the `tray.getBounds()` for windows and mac.

First, let's create an Electron app (I will not enter in details here, just a quick step-by-step list). You can also jump directly to the important part, [here](#creating-the-tray-icon).

1. `$ yarn init` to create an empty project.
2. Change the `main` property in the `package.json` to `main.js`.
3. Create a `main.js` file in the root of your project.
4. `$ yarn add electron --dev`.
5. Add a start script to your package.json, `"start": "electron ."`
6. Create an `index.html` in your project root.

In the `main.js` file, I will be using the Electron default code, found on their [documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app). With just some adjustments.

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow, Tray } = require('electron');
const path = require('path');

// Keep a global reference of the window object, if you don't, the window will
// be closed automatically when the JavaScript object is garbage collected.
let tray = null;
let window = null;

function createWindow() {
  // Create the browser window.
  window = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
    },
  });

  // and load the index.html of the app.
  window.loadFile('index.html');

  // Open the DevTools.
  window.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'detach' });
}

app.on('ready', () => {
  createWindow();
});

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit();
  }
});

app.on('activate', () => {
  // On macOS it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
  // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.
  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
    createWindow();
  }
});
```

In the `index.html`, I will also be using the same code as the Electron documentation (just an "Hello World").

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    <meta
      http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Creating the tray icon

Now, let's create a tray icon. In the `main.js` file, create a function `createTray`. Remember to import `Tray` from `'electron'`.
This function will create the tray with the icon image provided in the assets folder, so you need to create that folder and put the image inside.

```js
const createTray = () => {
  tray = new Tray(path.join(__dirname, 'assets', 'icon.png'));
};
```

Call this function only after the app is ready.

```js
app.on('ready', () => {
  createWindow();
  createTray();
});
```

Run the app again with `$ yarn start`, you will see that the tray will appear with your icon.

## Positioning the tray window

Now for the main part, clicking the tray icon to open the window in the correct position.  
Change the `show` option to false in the `BrowserWindow`, to not show the window after created.

```js
const window = new BrowserWindow({
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  show: false, // <- here
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: true,
  },
});
```

Create a function to toggle the window. So whenever we click the tray icon, it will show the window if it's hidden, and hide if it's not.

```js
const toggleWindow = () => {
  if (window.isVisible()) return window.hide();
  return showWindow();
};
```

Now the `showWindow` function, that is being used inside the `toggleWindow`, in this function we will correctly position the window before showing it. For that, we will be using the library [electron-traywindow-positioner](https://github.com/pixtron/electron-traywindow-positioner), which has everything built in to position the tray icon for all platforms, using the mouse position for Linux, and the tray bounds for windows and mac.

Install the library `$ yarn add electron-traywindow-positioner` and import it. After calling the positioner.position, it will change the position of the window, so you can just show it right after with `window.show()`.

```js
const positioner = require('electron-traywindow-positioner');

const showWindow = () => {
  positioner.position(window, tray.getBounds());
  window.show();
};
```

Add a click handler to the tray, that will call that function.

```js
const createTray = () => {
  tray = new Tray(path.join(__dirname, 'assets', 'icon.png'));
  tray.on('click', () => {
    toggleWindow();
  });
};
```

Now, every time you click the tray icon, it will toggle the window, and with the correct position!
That's it, very simple, but it's something that took me some time to find a great and simple solution.
